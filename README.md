# `ButtonBoy`: a local event logger for android

Source code for an event logger in android. Writes to a local database on your phone, can be exported to csv. Useful for unobtrusive event tracking.

Installer is in `app/release/app-release.apk`. You might have to enable third party installations. Caveat emptor,etc.
